            <h2><i class="primary fi-torso"></i> About Me</h2>
            <p>
                I've had a passion for web based technology for most of my life, and began learning HTML/CSS when I was only 12 years old. Based in the Fox Valley region in Wisconin, I have 5+ years of professional experience, and before that, worked on small freelance projects for several years. I consider myself a proficient full-stack developer, but maintain a passion and expertise on database driven application development, most frequently in PHP/MySQL with various frameworks. I am able to adapt to new technologies and languages quickly, and I put a passion into continuing to learn more about this ever-evolving field as much as I can.
            </p>
            <p>
                Beyond the technical realm, I have strong communication skills - especially in regards to working with a team, leading or supervising other team members, and communication with clients.
            </p>
